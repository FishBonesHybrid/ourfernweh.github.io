                  <h2>Florianopolis – Santa Catarina</h2>
                  <p>Florianopolis, capital of the State of Santa Catarina, is located in the south of Brazil and is actually an island where you have to cross over a bridge in order to reach the city. It was colonized mainly by the Portuguese during the 18th century, but other nations such as Germany and the Netherlands have quite strong roots in the city. You can find numerous colonies throughout the state that still speak German or Dutch. The city of Florianopolis is actually home to one of the biggest Oktoberfest festivals of South America! Tourists are mainly attracted to the city because of the mesmerizing beaches and nature, but the modern ‘Dark Tourist’ (yes that’s a thing now), come to Florianopolis for a completely different reason. Aside from it’s natural beauty, Florianopolis is also know as “Ilha da Magia” or Magical Island, where numerous urban legends of witches and werewolves come to life, unfortunately, we weren’t lucky enough to catch anything supernatural during our stay there.</p>

                  <h2>Mequi Mil – Sao Paulo/SP</h2>
                  <p>Mequi Mil, located in the city of Sao Paulo, considered the economic capital of Brazil, was built as a tribute and a motive for celebration in the Brazilian Mcdonald’s franchise because it was the 1000th Mcdonald’s restaurant opened in Brazil. They definitely went all out with the construction, even putting giant fries and a hamburger by the main doors. Since it is a ‘Brazilian’ franchise, you can definitely expect a more culturally appropriate menu, and types of food that you can only ever find in Brazil. This Mequi Mil is being considered the “Mcdonald’s of the future”, and is open for 24 hours, being able to accommodate up to 300 people! It has even been a location for some modern age marriages, I mean, who wouldn’t like to walk down the isle smelling like cheese burger?</p>

                  <h2>Museum do Olho – Curitiba/PR</h2>
                  <p>Museum do Olho as it is known to the local population, or Eye Museum when translated into English, is an Art and History museum located in the city of Curitiba, the capital of the State of Parana. It was built by famous Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer in the early 2000’s and it has been one of the major attractions of the city ever since. It is the biggest museum of Latin America, and the structure is precariously perched on top of a massive yellow 60 foot pillar. Easily sighted from miles away, the museum stares like a bright Cyclops eye out over calm reflecting pools, greeting visitors and watching over the coble-stoned streets. Although the museum houses many of Neimeyer’s works, it is also home to a regular rotation of other Brazilian’s impressive art work (I’m actually friends with an artist whose had numerous creations displayed in the museum!), but the building itself is the greatest work of art on display.</p>
