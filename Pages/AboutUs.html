            <p>Well hello there lovely human! (or alien, who knows -_-)
            It’s amazing you took the interest to read this absolutely self-absorbed page that is all about us. I can guarantee that by the end of this (hopefully not so long) post, you will have dipped your toes into the bottomless pool of who we are (and hopefully it’ll make you want to dive even further).</p>
            <p/>First things first, we are Vini and Thabata (her name is too big to have a cute abbreviation), and the main we reason we created this blog (aside from the fact that I needed a good grade for my college course) is because we love to travel! From the moment we ever became a thing, our love for travelling was something we shared so it just made sense to mash up that love and slowly but surely begin our adventure together.
            We are both from Brazil, Vini (that’s me!) from the well known city of Sao Paulo and Thabata from Curitiba. Since Brazil is a pretty big country, we had to move some rough 8600km across the globe to actually meet but from the moment we met we decided we wanted to travel together.</p>
            <p>Our first big trip was a trip we made to Amsterdam, France and Denmark. We were still pretty new to this whole travelling thing but we were able to make the most of it, especially since it we didn’t have a lot of time to spend in each country. We were also able to squeeze in a trip to Brazil at the start of 2020, right around the time COVID19 hit hard and unfortunately it was the last trip we were able to make. We had a lot of things planned (travel wise) for 2020 but those plans have been pushed back and hopefully we can pick up where we left off soon but until it is safe to do so, we have decided to try and explore more of the beautiful emerald Island we live on. Ireland is full of mesmerizing places to be found and we are going to do just that! So hold on 2021, we are coming for you!</p>
