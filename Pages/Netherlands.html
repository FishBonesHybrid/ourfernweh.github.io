                <h2>Dam Square</h2>
                <p>Dam Square is known as Amsterdam’s beating heart. It is a contrast between modern times and a times passed, giving the vibrant city an ancient, peaceful feeling, but Dam Square had been anything but peaceful in the past. The Square was the location of violent riots, revolts, protests and a killing ground for German soldiers in the Second World War. It carries with it a heavy past but luckily, the Square has been quiet in recent years, with the last riots happening in the 1980’s.
                A national monument was erected in the Square in 1956 in remembrance of those who died during World War II and every year, on the fourth of May, people, including representatives of the royal family, commemorate the victims of the war.</p>

                <h2>The Amsterdam Dungeon</h2>
                <p>The Amsterdam Dungeon is a uniquely thrilling attraction that whisks you back into the Netherlands most perilous past. Nasty tales of scurvy at sea and the black plague throughout the Netherlands are told by extremely talented actors that really involve the audience and interact with the terrifyingly decorated rooms. It was a fun way to learn a little bit more about some of the horrible history of the Dutch, but again… in a fun way.</p>
