                <h2>Side Tracked</h2>
                <p>As a magazine, Side tracked have unbelievable standards for both their photography and their writing. Of course, they have a team of people that write/photograph for the magazine but that is just part of what makes it wonderful. Having the opportunity to read from different perspectives, people who believe different things and see the world different ways is just enriching. So mostly, their magazine to me is a point of inspiration, a place I can pluck knowledge and better myself.</p>

                <h2>The Blonde Abroad</h2>
                <p>The Blonde Abroad has served as inspiration for numerous women around the world. She has helped women push the boundaries of their own fear and break the stigma that women can't travel on their own. She shares useful tips to women who want to follow in the same footsteps, travel information about countries and other helpful tips that make women feel safer when travelling.

                <h2>Notes From The Road</h2>
                <p>Notes from the road has had some crazy journeys and he shares all of those adventures with his followers. His travelling style is a lot more focused on wilderness and on more unconventional travel spots, so he's a great inspiration for those looking for excitement and those looking to go off the beaten path.</p>

                <h2>Maptia</h2>
                <p>Maptia is about telling stories. It is not a typical travel blog because it doesn't give tips on how to travel, rather it shows us the lives of those native to the countries. It tells us stories about real people and captures their essence. As they mention in their website, they foster empathy through storytelling and we feel connected to those they talk about.</p>

                <h2>Passaport In One Hand</h2>
                <p>Passport in one hand, or rather Laura and Nicolas, as I first came to know them, focus their blog on photography tips. They share their love of travelling of course, giving tips and pointers about the places they've been, but the biggest way they show their love is through their photography. On the blog they also share some of the presets they've created and use to edit their photos, with tutorials and useful information on how to take the perfect picture.</p>
