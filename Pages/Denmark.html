                <h2>Tivoli Gardens</h2>
                <p>Tivoli Gardens is not actually a garden, but an amusement park. It opened in 1843 founded by a man named Georg Carstensen and it is the second oldest amusement park in the world! It is believed that Mr. Carstensen convinced the reigning King of the time to allow him to build the park in order for the peasants to have fun and take their minds off poverty and politics. The original Chinese themed decorations were actually inspired by writer Hans Christian Andersen and it is just beautiful, especially in the night time. People say that after a trip oversees, Walt Disney was inspired by what he saw at Tivoli that he created Disneyland based on similar concepts. The Gardens is definitely a must for tourists and it will feel like walking through something out of a fairytale.</p>

                <h2>Kronborg Castle</h2>
                <p>Kronborg Castle, A.K.A Hamlet’s castle… yes, Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Apparently, Kronborg castle is where the famous play Hamlet, written by Shakespeare took place, and it has in fact been one of the main filming location for many remakes of the play. The castle was built in the 1420’s by Eric of Pomerania, who was the Danish King at the time. It is located only 2.5 miles away from Sweden, and it’s funny because when walking through the grounds of the castle, our phones changed settings from Denmark to Sweden automatically.
                From 1739 until the 1900’s, the castle was actually used as a prison where violent or “dishonest” criminals were forced to serve their time doing hard labor inside the castle walls, and it actually became a UNESCO world Heritage Site in 2000.</p>

                <h2>Nyhavn</h2>
                <p>Nyhavn, which actually means “New Harbour” is the most famous street in the Danish Capital City lined with colorful townhouses, seen in countless postcards. King Christian V built the Nyhavn Canal between 1670-1673, or rather, he used Swedish war prisoners to build it for him. The canal was a working port for a whole 3 centuries, which means it was the popular hang out spot for sailors, drunks and prostitutes, and it was actually a red-district light district up until about 1960 when it was re-branded.  Now modern day Nyhavn Is lined with bars, restaurants (some which stay open 24 hours) and live music venues.</p>
