                <h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
                <p>The Eiffel Tower is a 324 meter tall structure situated in Paris. It was named after Gustave Eiffel, the engineer whose company designed and built the tower. The French lovingly call it “La dame de fer” and it is the world’s most visited paid monument! It took three hundred steel workers two years, two months and five days to build it, with the tower finally being finished in 1889. It was meant to stand at the Champ-de-Mars for only twenty years but it was a hit, and someone also realized that the top of the tower was the perfect place for a telegraphy antenna, and this antenna helped jam German communications during the First World War. In current times though, the Eiffel Tower is a popular place for marriage proposal, being ranked fourth most popular spot on Instagram..</p>

                <h2>The Arc de Triomphe</h2>
                <p>The Arc de Triomphe is another of the most famous monuments in Paris, standing in one of the most iconic streets of Paris, the Champs-Elysees. The Arc de Triomphe honors those who fought and died for France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. Interestingly enough, the Arc nearly lost its’ place to a gigantic elephant! Another interesting (albeit disturbing fact), is that there have been two assassination attempts in the Arc. The most important attraction of the Arc though, is the eternal flame that burns inside, lit on the 11th of November 1923 and has not been extinguished since. Every evening at 18:30, wreaths are laid into the flames by veterans to keep it eternally burning.</p>

                <h2>Catacombs of Paris</h2>
                <p>The Catacombs of Paris are underground ossuaries in Paris that hold the remains of more than six million people. The ossuary was created in an attempt to eliminate the city’s overflowing cemeteries. As the bones were brought into the Catacombs (in the dead of night), they were dumped in piles, completely disorganized as remains were removed from Paris’s cemeteries. Louis Hericart de Thury, a French politician, took it upon himself to organize the transformation of the quarries into the eerie art that exists in the Catacombs till this day. As bones were organized in the Catacombs they were formed into a variety of shapes, hearts, crosses, a giant barrel of femurs and skulls, but other art is also to be found in the Catacombs. A quarry worker by the name of Francois Décure spent some of his time working in the quarries creating small, but incredible sculptures in the walls of the limestone sections of the Catacombs. Other than being a place for bones and art, the Catacombs also became a farm for fresh mushrooms in the 19th century! Although the Catacombs aren’t everybody’s cup of tea, it is still an interesting place to go if you’re looking for something to spice up the trip. </p>
